===========

What is this?
------------
The truth is that I don't even know, but... eventually we will make something from this frankenstein.... would you like to be part of it?

Why?
------------
I am testing some packages that I find interesting and I will try to do something with them, maybe a game, maybe a monster, maybe a CMS, a wedding app, maybe a super cluster but surely not something work related! (I use **bitbucket** for that!)

About the content
-------------------------------------

I don't know much about what I am going to do, but I know that I will include something related to racoons!!

**This is why:**
